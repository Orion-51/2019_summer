# 2019_summer
The main results of my summer research project at the IFA in Edinburgh

I started with the ab_model program, in order to familiarise myself with concepts such as parameter estimation using chi-squared, and general practises in research and programming. I also gained insight into the chainconsumer package

Next was the omsig_model, a step up from the simple linear model, incorporating things such as importing data from external files, as well as sampling over different parameters.
